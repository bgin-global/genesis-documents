## Purpose
As blockchain could affect a wide range of social and economic activities, the way we fulfill social interests globally, which currently largely depends on regulation and its enforcement, may have to change as well. At this early stage of development, we should start designing new mechanisms to ensure the sustainable development of this new ecosphere by involving a wide range of stakeholders.

The Blockchain Governance Initiative Network (BGIN) will take a leading role to develop healthy governance where stakeholders cultivate common understanding, enhance dialogue, and work together to make a significant positive impact on the ecosphere and society at large. 

## Tentative goals
To serve the above purpose, BGIN tentatively aims at
1. Creating an open, global and neutral platform for multi-stakeholder dialogue
2. Developing a common language and understandings among stakeholders with diverse perspectives
3.  Building academic anchors through continuous provision of trustable documents and codes based on open source-style approach 

## Key activities
Taking into the above purpose and tentative goals, the BGIN:
- Provides open, global, and neutral fora for discussion of issues that affect the development of the ecosystem in technical, business, regulatory, societal, and other contexts. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *(At the inaugural meeting, setting up the Working Group on Governance issues of BGIN was decided and Aaron Wright and Shigeya Suzuki were appointed as acting co-chairs.)*
- Hosts regular,  ad hoc meetings and events to enhance dialogue, cultivate common understanding, and promote cooperation among stakeholders 
- Actively outreaches to a variety of stakeholders and works together with affiliated organizations to foster well-balanced discussions
- Creates material outcomes that influence the way people design, use, and manage blockchain/DLT based on fair, academic and technology-driven discussions within Working Groups: Proceedings/Reference documents/Working papers with contribution from all stakeholders

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *(At the inaugural meeting, setting up the Study Group on Key management, Identity and Privacy issues was decided and Katharina Pistor and Nat Sakimura were appointed as acting co-conveners.)*
- Contributes to public policy design and implementation through constructive communication with global standard-setters and jurisdictional regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authorities 

Note: BGIN would operate under a non-profit organization with a healthy and sustainable organizational structure and sound governance mechanism.  

## Roadmap and tentative future plans
